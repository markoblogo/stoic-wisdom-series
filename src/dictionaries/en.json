This edition reimagines Epictetus in toki pona for a calmer, more inspectable kind of reading. What you get in this volume: Public-domain English reference text (Elizabeth Carter, 1758) for comparison. Two-layer toki pona reading format: Latin script + the same line repeated for sitelen pona. A reading method designed for slow progress: small daily units, repetition, and “What is the instruction?” as the main question. Links to the free beginner kit and the series page. Created & curated by Biletskyi-Volokh Anton."

      "shortDesc": "A sharp, calming reminder that life isn’t “too short” — we simply waste much of it. Readable, practical Stoic advice on attention, priorities, and reclaiming your days, reimagined in toki pona.",
      "longDesc": "“Life is short” is the common complaint. Seneca’s answer is tougher and more useful: the problem isn’t the length of life, but what we trade it for. This short classic is a practical guide to noticing waste, resisting distraction, and investing your days on purpose. This edition is part of Stoic Wisdom in Toki Pona — classic Stoic texts reimagined in the world’s simplest language. The English text is public domain; the toki pona version is a new creative work, written to keep the language clean, small, and readable while preserving Seneca’s practical force. Reading help is built into the edition: the translation keeps key phrases stable so repeated ideas stay easy to spot, and the glossary is designed around recurring “anchor patterns.” You can also start with the free Reader’s Kit and links provided in the book."

      "shortDesc": "A practical handbook for moral decision-making in real life—promises, reputation, money, public duty, friendship, and pressure—reimagined in toki pona with sitelen pona for slow, clear rereading.",
      "longDesc": "Cicero’s On Duties is built for the hardest everyday question: what to do when advantage pulls one way and conscience pulls another. This edition keeps the public-domain English reference text for comparison, then presents a full toki pona translation in two reading layers—Latin script and sitelen pona—so you can reread the same claims with fresh attention. Book I lays the foundation: what moral rightness is, where it comes from, and how it becomes practical rules you can carry into any situation. Book II tests “useful” choices in work, wealth, reputation, favors, and public life. Book III is the stress test: when the honorable and the useful seem to clash, Cicero argues that real advantage can’t be built on injustice—and that “benefit” bought by wrongdoing is a hidden debt paid later by you or the community."
